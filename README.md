anti-sosial suite is a startup company aimed at developin social media management tools for automation. 
the first tool developed is call Mass Task. At anti social suite we believe that botting can be used for good! Ethical botting consists of quality over quantity and a screaning process. Developing real people's social media presenc though easy to use UX design attached to robust automation tools in the backend.

## Mass Task (MT)
starting at $99/mo manage any and all outreach tasks, like message campaigns, follow sprees, like spams, and following cleaning.
initiate a task right now or schedule a task for later. run a predesiigned task every tuesday if you like. We beleave businesses and influential people need to focus on what they do best, creating content and running their business/brand, NOT spending hours on social media and inevitable being sucked into a reel loop, waisting time and money.

## task trigger (TT) (comming soon)
this will monitor events and trigger task:
~ auto respond to messages
~ auto follow back users
~ text and email notification based on hash tags and posts

EXAMPLE:
utilizing parent child marketing. have task that trigger across the children
account when you post to start doing outreach to as many potential followers as allowed by instagrams interaction limit

## post scheduling (PS) (coming soon)
