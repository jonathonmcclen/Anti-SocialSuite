# The Suite

## 1. Control (Ctrl)
starting at $99/mo manage any and all outreach tasks, like message campaigns, follow sprees, like spams, and following cleaning.
initiate a task right now or schedule a task for later. run a predesiigned task every tuesday if you like. We beleave businesses and influential people need to focus on what they do best, creating content and running their business/brand, NOT spending hours on social media and inevitable being sucked into a reel loop, waisting time and money.

## 2. task trigger (TT) (comming soon)
this will monitor events and trigger task:
~ auto respond to messages
~ auto follow back users
~ text and email notification based on hash tags and posts

EXAMPLE:
utilizing parent child marketing. have task that triggers across the children
accounts when parent accounts posts. The children interact with post and tag followers.

## post scheduling (PS) (coming soon)
